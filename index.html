					<h2> University students struggle to make friendships.</h2>

					<p class="p-section">Humans are inherently social creatures. We crave a form of belonging and a
						sense of connectedness
						that has been hard-wired into our behavior for survival since the beginning of human evolution.
						So as a university student, the rigor of college and its ever-changing schedules make it
						difficult to connect with other students, especially those who want to communicate with others
						but struggle to make that first step due to personal barriers. As a senior, I noticed how many
						of my peers, especially the juniors, found it difficult to find this sense of belonging and
						connectedness, sparking the question-why was there such disconnect in our lives? And how might
						we help university students make friends faster?

					<h2>UniMeets: an events-based networking app that connects students through shared interests.</h2>
					<p class="p-section">The goal of my project was to provide a head-start for students who struggle
						with social
						interaction yet want to increase their social circle. So I tried to rethink how students could
						engage in more fun, meaningful, and productive ways to build those friendships to form sincere
						connections.</p>
					<p class="p-section">UniMeets is an events-based networking app that allows users to create profiles
						and add interests
						that generate events based on the user's interests. Users need to mark an event they want to
						attend where they will be grouped with other students who will also be in attendance. From
						there, they will automatically be added to a group chat where they can introduce themselves and
						get to know one another, to eventually attend the event and meet peers from their school.</p>

					<h2>The competition had NO audience specific to university students.</h2>

					<p class="p-section">I began doing some research to see what's currently out there. I noted down the
						four most popular
						platforms, identified vital features I envisioned UniMeets to have, and reassessed existing
						platforms based on those features. To my surprise, various friend apps also included an
						event-based element. However, no specific event app caters explicitly to university students.
						Although there are also social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook, those sites are
						more for maintaining friendships than creating new ones. </p>

					<h2>The primary motivator for students to attend events is based on which friends are attending;
						therefore, getting to know others before the event will be critical for our users.</h2>

					<p class="p-section">After listing down my assumptions, I formed survey questions to address gaps in
						my knowledge to understand the overall perspective of various students. Using surveys with 12
						students between the ages of 18 - 25, I quickly discovered three crucial
						points.

						<li>How do they hear about specific events in their locality, and how often do they attend them?
						</li>
						<li>What criteria do they consider before attending events? </li>

					<h2>Setbacks + a new direction for new friendships.
					</h2>
					<p class="p-section">At first, I spent the first 2 - 3 weeks brainstorming, wireframing, and
						designing a social networking app solely catered towards uni students. But I kept hesitating on
						the idea because I thought, if I did that, how would it be any different from any other social
						networking apps out there? Then I figured, maybe Augmented Reality? But then, not everyone will
						have access to the equipment, which would become more of a hassle than a benefit. Plus, the same
						effects that you could have using AR could be used through a simple smartphone app. So I decided
						to
						beef up the social networking approach instead by catering to events and
						using a topic that will make people come together based on what they are interested in, which
						would be a great icebreaker when making friends. Hence why I stuck with an app for my final
						solution.</p>

					<p class="p-section">To better understand this project's scope, I identified three key features
						using the main pain
						points of the user story. I found that planning out the task flow early on helped me make better
						design decisions as I could identify areas of opportunities. The key tasks users needed to be
						able to accomplish were:</p>

					<p class="p-heading">Conclusion</p>
					<h2>Reflections + what I'd do differently next time.</h2>

					<p class="p-section">
						This was my first-ever solo UX project ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³. More than the actual output, I'm grateful to have
						been
						through an entire UX process, so I can see what it's actually like. Here are a few things I've
						learned:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong style="font-size: 18px; font-style: Montserrat;">Iterate as much as you
								can.</strong>
							I explored many different options in the beginning stages to find the right solution for my
							student users. I ended up "restarting" my project three times through brainstorming,
							wireframing, and thinking of solutions outside of technology to ensure every aspect of the
							app was intended.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong style="font-size: 18px; font-style: Montserrat;">Be decisive.</strong> After I had
							finally made my decision for the direction of this app and began
							researching and discovering major pain points for the users, my first version of this case
							study was full of unnecessary texts, and instead of making features to solve the issue, I
							was adding more features and ideas to the project instead of building on a single foundation
							then branching out. Thus, in the future, I believe focusing more on one idea that solves the
							pain points and building upon that will reduce the time to complete the case study.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong style="font-size: 18px; font-style: Montserrat;">The only real mistake is the one
								from which we learn nothing.</strong>
							From catching errors in my UI to uncovering more foundational UX problems in my app, I'm
							thankful for online resources and the Human-Computer Interaction course I did at uni, which
							I could fall back to when I needed guidance. Though there is a lot more room for
							improvement, I have made the app as best I could and did not let my own thoughts and
							opinions stop me from questioning if my own decisions were truly best for the user.
						</li>
					</ul>
